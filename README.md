# Craftable Treasure Bags (1.4)

Craftable Treasure Bags, by Setnour6.

Have you ever wanted to get expert mode exclusive boss drops in normal mode? Well now you can, with Craftable Treasure Bags. This mod allows you to get expert mode items in normal mode, from crafting boss treasure bags and opening them right in normal mode!

This mod contains recipes for all vanilla boss treasure bags (except for the Wall of Flesh and bosses/minibosses from the Old One's Army).

All treasure bags are to be crafted with an empty treasure bag at a Demon Altar, as well as certain items that can be used to make treasure bags. Make sure to also have the boss summoning item.
Craft an empty treasure bag with 10 silk at a loom.
Craft a boss treasure bag with boss loot and the respective boss summon item (some other recipes require different items as well besides boss loot only).

Differences from the 1.3 version of this mod:
- More Treasure Bag Recipes.
- Cleaner and more balanced recipe display.
- Skeletron's Treasure Bag can be crafted in two ways (one of them involves a certain criteria).
