Have you ever wanted to get expert mode exclusive boss drops in normal mode? Well now you can, with Craftable Treasure Bags. This mod allows you to get expert mode items in normal mode, from crafting boss treasure bags and opening them right in normal mode!

This mod contains recipes for all vanilla boss treasure bags (except for the Wall of Flesh and bosses/minibosses from the Old One's Army).

All treasure bags are to be crafted with an empty treasure bag and a boss summoning item at a Demon Altar, as well as certain items that are to be used to craft the treasure bags, which depend on the boss summoning item you intend to craft with.
Craft an empty treasure bag with 10 silk and a black string at a loom.
Craft a boss treasure bag with the respective boss summon item and certain ingredients (some other recipes require different items as well besides boss loot only).

This mod also contains boss treasure bag recipes for the following 1.4 mods
- Qwerty's Bosses and Items

Differences from the 1.3 version of this mod:
- More realistic treasure bag recipes (you'll see).
- Cleaner and more balanced recipe display.
- Skeletron's Treasure Bag can be crafted in two ways (one of them involves a certain criteria).
